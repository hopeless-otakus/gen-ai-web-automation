caption:  "The Global Commission on Responsible Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain (GC REAIM) is an initiative of the Government of the Netherlands that was launched during the 2023 REAIM Summit on Responsible Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain in The Hague.  Upon request of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies acts as the Secretariat of the Commission. GC REAIM is being established, for an initial period of two years, to help promote mutual awareness and understanding among the many communities working on issues related to the global governance of AI in the military domain. By linking dialogues between these communities, the Global Commission will contribute to an essential global task: supporting fundamental norm development and policy coherence in this field."
