This project focuses on designing social interventions to improve health outcomes for pregnant mothers. Existing work [1, 2, 3] proposes Restless Multi-Armed Bandit-based allocation algorithms, including methods [4] to shape allocation policy using large language models (LLMs) based on English-language commands. In this project, the research objectives are to:

 (1) Identify the fairness and bias impact of multilinguality (including low-resource languages) in such an LLM-based approach
 
 (2) Explore techniques for debiasing and improving fairness.
