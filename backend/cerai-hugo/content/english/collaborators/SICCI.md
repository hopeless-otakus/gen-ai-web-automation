The Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI), which has completed hundred years of excellence and enterprise in service to the southern region of this nation, is one of the oldest but largest and prestigious institutions of its kind in India. It was established in 1909 under the inspiration of the Father of Nation, MAHATMA GANDHI who initiated the Swadeshi Movement in his quest for political and social freedom for India. But the goal of the SICCI was for India to attain economic freedom for the industry which would then drive inclusive social growth. Ever since its establishment, this regional body has grown from strength to strength under the dynamic leadership of a galaxy of eminent Presidents.
