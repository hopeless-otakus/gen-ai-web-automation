The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) is a global non-profit organisation founded in 1992 in Silicon Valley by a group of successful entrepreneurs, corporate executives, and senior professionals. Over the last 30 years of existence, TiE chapters worldwide have been fostering entrepreneurship through mentoring, networking and education of seasoned and aspiring entrepreneurs alike. There are currently 15,000 members (including over 3000 charter members or mentors) in 61 chapters across 14 countries. The TiE community worldwide has grown to be a vibrant platform for entrepreneurs, professionals, industry leaders and investors to interact with one another and forge long-lasting relationships.

Several members have formed start-ups while at TiE and are now charter members giving back to the community. TiEâ€™s ultimate goal is to foster entrepreneurship, create wealth for both the entrepreneur and the local communities, and nurture the next generation of entrepreneurs.
