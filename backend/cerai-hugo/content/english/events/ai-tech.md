Abstract: Responsible AI is at its commercial inflection point. While there are 80 countries working on emerging regulations, international standards organization working on over 45 standards, expanding number of short digital courses (over 50 courses on Udemy), increased discussions at industry seminars and panels, evolving conversations on social media regarding responsible and trustworthy Data and AI, the question remains “is RAI at its commercial inflection point?”

Modulating return on investment from AI, hazy clarity on regulatory expectations, mounting estimates on compliance costs, pervasive lack of skillsets and unestablished economic incentives for adoption are becoming key hurdles in Responsible AI journey.

With a little over 14k professionals, Responsible AI can become an important integral in enhancing value proposition of emerging technology. But how?

This session will delve into roadblocks and opportunities regarding commercial adoption of RAI.
