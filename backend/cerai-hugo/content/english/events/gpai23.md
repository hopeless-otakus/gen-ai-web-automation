## Advancing Responsible AI in Public Sector Applications


The **Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI)** is an international and multi-stakeholder initiative to guide the responsible development and use of AI, grounded in human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation, and economic growth.

As the council chair of GPAI, India will host the Annual GPAI Summit in December 2023 in New Delhi, India. The Summit will see participation from AI Experts, multilateral organizations, and other relevant stakeholders from over 28 GPAI member countries and the European Union.

As part of the Annual GPAI Summit, the **Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)**, in collaboration with the **Centre for Responsible AI (CeRAI) at IIT Madras** is organizing a Research Symposium. The Research Symposium will provide a platform for Indian and International academics and researchers to collaborate with other AI experts and present their work in front of a global audience.
